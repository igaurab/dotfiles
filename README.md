My dotfiles for vim, tmux and i3

## Zsh Setup
Nothing fancy here. Just used the defaults from (Oh My Zsh)[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh]

## Vim Setup

Vim-plug for plugin management.

Copy the `.vimrc` and `.vim` folder to your `$HOME` directory

Run `PlugInstall` to install all the plugins

The plugins are located under a seperate file named `plug.vim` inside the `.vim` directory

## tmux setup

tmux setup is preety straightforward. I have used a starter pack from [Oh My Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux). Follow the installation directions and just replace the `.tmux.conf.local` file in the `$HOME` directory.


> The necessary fonts are located on .fonts folder. Copy the fonts to ~/.fonts
If you are using gnmoe, the fonts installed will not show on your preferences of your terminal.
You will have to install `Gnome Tweaks` and setup the system wise fonts. The font I have used is `Fura Code Mono Medium"
